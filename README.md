calibratr
---------

This simple package has a few functions that are wrappers to make the calibration function in
R's `survey` package a little easier to use.

You should be able to install this package by typing 

    `devtools::install_github('dfeehan/calibratr')`

at the R prompt. (You'll need to have the `devtools` package installed for this to work.)
